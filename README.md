# Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Downtown Toronto is a buzzing area filled with shopping areas, restaurants, nightlife, parks, cultural venues, and an eclectic mix of neighborhoods. A businessman wants to invest by opening a new business but he is confused about which new business should he start. To help a businessman we have done clustering of all the neighborhoods based on the top venues in the neighborhood. Now a businessman can decide what type of business he can start in a particular neighborhood.
